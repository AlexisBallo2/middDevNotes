# Installation

Open vscode and create a new folder. 
Open a new terminal (tab at the top)
![[Pasted image 20240410214837.png|400]]
```shell
npx create-next-app@latest --no-eslint --js --tailwind --app --use-npm --src-dir
```
Enter your new project name and accept all the defaults

Cd into the folder in the terminal: 
```shell
cd [[name]]
```
In the terminal install the node packages that we will need to run the server: 
```shell
npm i
```

# Basics

Start your development server
```shell
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

Your should see this page:

This page comes from the "/src/app/page.js" file:
![[Pasted image 20240410215544.png]]

Delete everything in the (). And replace it with: 
```html
<div>
  Hello!
</div>
```

your entire file should be: 
```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      Hello!
    </div>
  );
}
```


Now see how the page has changed:

Delete the default styling line from "layout.js". It should look like this: 
```jsx
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Next.js treats all of our "pages" as components - and fills them in the `{children}` block. So on the index page, the `{children}` bit will be replaced by our export from our page.js

# Styling
In the `/src/` directory - add a `/styles/` folder:
