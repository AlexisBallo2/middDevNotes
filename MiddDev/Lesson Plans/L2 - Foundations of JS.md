Now that we have cloned our repository, we can begin to learn some JS. Don't worry about trying to understand everything yet - we will get there. For now - only ensure you understand the steps that we are explicitly teaching. 

JS needs an "engine" to run - something that actually runs the JS code. Historically websites were just html/css/js files, and your browser executed the js files. Nowadays, websites are much more complicated, and frameworks allow us to create much more advanced websites with much less code. The framework we will be using is also written in JS - and therefore we need to run this framework locally. We can do this by using "node" to run our server. 

Node is a JS engine that allows us to run JS without a browser. First lets install the dependencies. Navigate the the directory and type 
```shell
npm i
```
you can ignore the packages that this installs. 

Next run the application:
```shell
npm run dev
```
this will create 



The framework we will be using (the server/frontend/management system/etc) will also be running on
